<pre><code>Each linedef represents a line from one of the VERTEXES to another,
and each linedef's record is 14 bytes, containing 7 &lt;short&gt; fields:

(1) from the VERTEX with this number (the first vertex is 0).
(2) to the VERTEX with this number (31 is the 32nd vertex).
(3) flags, see [4-3-1] below.
(4) types, see [4-3-2] below.
(5) is a &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;trigger&quot; number which ties this line's effect type
      to all SECTORS that have the same tag number (in their last
      field).
(6) number of the &quot;right&quot; SIDEDEF for this linedef.
(7) &quot;left&quot; SIDEDEF, if this line adjoins 2 SECTORS. Otherwise, it is
      equal to -1 (FFFF hex).

  &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; are based on the direction of the linedef as
indicated by the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;, or &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, VERTEXES.
This sketch should make it clear:

             left side               right side
    start -----------------&gt; end &lt;----------------- start
             right side              left side

  IMPORTANT: All lines must have a right side. If it is a one-sided
line, then it must go the proper direction, so its single side is
facing the sector it is part of. DOOM will crash on a level that has
a line with no right side.


[4-3-1]: Linedef Flags
----------------------

  The third &lt;short&gt; field of each linedef controls some attributes of
that line. These attributes (aka flags) are indicated by bits. If the
bit is set (equal to 1), the condition is true for that line. If the
bit is not set (equal to 0), the condition is not true. Note that the
&quot;unpegged&quot; flags cannot be independently set for the two SIDEDEFs of
a line. Here's a list of the flags, followed by a discussion of each:

bit     Condition

0       Impassible
1       Block Monsters
2       Two-sided
3       Upper Unpegged
4       Lower Unpegged
5       Secret
6       Block Sound
7       Not on Map
8       Already on Map
9-15    unused

  0 (Impassible) - Players and monsters cannot cross this line. Note that
if there is no sector on the other side, they can't go through the line
anyway, regardless of the flags.

  1 (Block Monsters) - Monsters cannot cross this line.

  2 (Two-sided) - The linedef's two sidedefs can have &quot;-&quot; as a texture,
which in this case means &quot;transparent&quot;. If this flag is not set, the
sidedefs can't be transparent: if &quot;-&quot; is viewed, it will result in the
&quot;hall of mirrors&quot; effect. However, a linedef CAN have two non-transparent
sidedefs, even if this flag is not set, as long as it is between two
sectors.
  Another side effect of this flag is that if it is set, then gunfire
(pistol, shotgun, chaingun) can go through it. If this flag is not set,
gunfire cannot go through the line. Projectiles (rockets, plasma etc.)
are not restricted this way. They can go through as long as there's a
sector on the other side (and the sector heights allow it).
  Finally, monsters can see through and attack through two-sided lines,
despite any of the line's other flag settings and textures (once again,
provided sector heights and the REJECT [4-10] allow it).

  3 (Upper unpegged) - The upper texture is pasted onto the wall from
the top down instead of from the bottom up like usual.
  Upper textures normally have the bottom of the wall texture to be
drawn lined up with the bottom of the &quot;upper&quot; space in which it is
to be drawn (sidedef Y offsets then apply [4-4]). This can result
in the upper texture being misaligned with a neighboring &quot;middle&quot;
texture. To help solve this problem, common at &quot;windows&quot;, this flag
can be set.
  If the upper texture is unpegged, it is drawn with the wall texture's
top row at the ceiling, just like middle and lower textures are usually
drawn. This can help realign the upper texture with a neighbor.

  The article TEXTURES, cited in appendix [A-4] gives a great deal
more explanation on the &quot;unpegged&quot; flags and how to use them.

  4 (Lower unpegged) - Lower and middle textures are drawn from the
bottom up, instead of from the top down like usual.
  This is also commonly used on lower textures under &quot;windows&quot;. It is
also used on doorjambs, because when the door opens, the sector ceiling
is rising, so the &quot;sides&quot; (the doorjambs), which are middle textures,
will be drawn from the ever-changing ceiling height down, and thus will
appear to be &quot;moving&quot;. Unpegging them will make them be drawn from the
floor up, and since the floor height doesn't change when a door opens,
then will not move.
  There's one slight difference with lower textures being unpegged -
they are not necessarily drawn with the bottom of the wall texture placed
at the bottom of the wall. The height of the facing sector and the height
of the wall texture are taken into account. So if the sector is 160 high,
and the wall texture is 128 high, then lower unpegged will cause the 32nd
row of the wall texture to be at the floor, NOT the 128th row. This of
course excludes sidedef Y offsets, which are applied AFTER unpegged
flags do their stuff.

  5 (Secret) - On the automap, this line appears in red like a normal
solid wall that has nothing on the other side. This is useful in
protecting secret doors and such. Note that if the sector on the other
side of this &quot;secret&quot; line has its floor height HIGHER than the sector
on the facing side of the secret line, then the map will show the lines
beyond and thus give up the secret.
  Also note that this flag has NOTHING to do with the SECRETS ratio on
inter-level screens. That's done with special sector 9 (see [4-9-1]).

  6 (Block Sound) - For purposes of monsters hearing sounds and thus
becoming alerted. Every time a player fires a weapon, the &quot;sound&quot; of
it travels from sector to sector, alerting all non-deaf monsters in
each new sector. But the sound will die when it hits a second line
with this flag. The sound can cross one such line, but not two. All
possible routes for the sound to take are taken, so it can get to
some out-of-the-way places. Another thing that blocks sound, instantly,
is incompatible sector heights. Sound can go from a sector with 0/72
floor/ceiling heights to one with 64/192, but the sound CANNOT go
from a 0/128 sector to an adjacent 128/256 sector.

  7 (Not on Map) - The line is not shown on the automap, even if the
computer all-map power up is acquired.

  8 (Already on Map) - When the level is begun, this line is already
on the automap, even though it hasn't been seen (in the display) yet.
Normally lines only get mapped once part of the line has been seen in
the display window.

  Automap line colors: Red lines indicate the line is one-sided, that
there is a sector on only one side (or the line is marked secret).
Brown lines are between two sectors with different floor heights but
the same ceiling height. Yellow lines are between two sectors with
different ceiling heights and the same or different floor heights.
Gray lines are as-yet-unseen lines revealed by the computer all-map.
Without the all-map, lines between sectors with identical floor and
ceiling heights don't show up. With it, they are gray.


[4-3-2]: Linedef Types
----------------------

  The &lt;short&gt; in field 4 of 7 of a linedef can control various special
effects like doors opening, floors moving, etc. Some of them must be
activated by &quot;using&quot; them, like switches, and some of them are activated
when they are walked over. There are a huge number of ways to use these
effects, but it's all done by using one of a hundred or so line function
types.
  The most common way they work is this: a player walks across a line
or activates (presses the spacebar or the use key) right in front of
a line. That line has a function type that is non-zero. It also has
a tag number. Then ALL sectors on the level with the same tag number,
that are not already engaged in some action, undergo the effects that
the linedef type number dictates. Note that the tag numbers are NOT the
sector numbers, nor the linedef numbers. A tag number is in a lindef's
5th &lt;short&gt; field, and a sector's last &lt;short&gt; field.

Explanations of all the abbreviations in the table:

Val     The value of the linedef &quot;type&quot; field (#4). If you want them
          in numerical order, use SORT or something.
*       This line function only works in 1.666 and up
Class   The category of the effect
Act     Activation. How the linedef's effect is activated.
n       does NOT require a tag number (see note 5 below)
W       walk-over activation
S       switch (&quot;use&quot; - default config is spacebar)
G       gunfire (pistol, shotgun, chaingun) cross or hit line
1       the line may be activated once only
R       potentially repeatable activation
&amp;       affected sectors &quot;locked out&quot; from further changes. See notes 9/10.
m       Monster actions can activate the line's effect
Sound   The type of noise made by moving sectors
Speed   How quickly a floor moves up/down etc.
Tm      Time - how long it &quot;rests&quot;; doors &quot;rest&quot; when they've gone as
          high as they're going to go, lifts &quot;rest&quot; at the bottom, etc.
Chg     Change - some of them cause a floor texture change and/or special
          sector change. See note 11 below.
T       Trigger model, see note 11 below.
N       Numeric model, see note 11 below.
X       Floor texture is transferred, and Sector type 0.
P       Special Sector types 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 16 transfer.
Effect  What happens to the affected sector(s).
open    The ceiling goes (up) to LEC-4.
close   The ceiling goes (down) to the floor level.
up      Will move up at specified speed if the destination is above.
          If the destination is below, it arrives there instantly.
down    Will move down at specified speed if the destination is below.
          If the destination is above, it arrives there instantly.
open/   The door can be activated while moving. If it's open or opening,
  close   it closes. If it's closed or closing, it opens, then pauses,
          then closes.
open,   The door can only be activated if it is in the closed state.
  close   It opens, pauses, then closes.
lift    The floor goes down to LIF, rests, then back up to original height.
L       lowest
H       highest
C       ceiling
F       floor
E       adjacent sectors, excluding the affected sector
I       adjacent sectors, including the affected sector
nh      next-higher, i.e. LEF that is higher than source.

  More notes and longer discussions related to these terms:

1.  &quot;Adjacent&quot; is any sector that shares a LINEDEF with the tagged sector
(sectors are adjacent to themselves).
2.  All S activations and the teleporters only work from the RIGHT side
of the linedef.
3.  For teleporters, if more than 1 sector is tagged the same and each
has a teleport landing THING, then the lowest numbered sector is the
destination.
4.  Floors that raise up an absolute height (up 24, 32) will go up INTO
ceilings, so using the WR and SR types of these in levels is unwise.
5.  A few of the linedef types don't require tag numbers: the end-level
switches, the scrolling wall type 48 (0x30), and the &quot;manual&quot; doors which
operate on the sector facing the left side of the linedef with the manual
door line type.
666.  Here's the terms id uses for different types of activations:
        Manual: nSR and nS1 doors
        Trigger: W1
        Retrigger: WR
        Switch: S1
        Button: SR
        Impact: G
        Effect: line 48 is the only one
7.  The &quot;moving floors&quot; go up to a maximum of HIF and go down to a minimum
of LIF. Why they sometimes go up first and sometimes down is still a
mystery to me.
8.  The &quot;crushing ceilings&quot; go from their original ceiling height down
to (floor + 8), then back up. While crushing a creature, their downward
speed slows considerably. &quot;Fast hurt&quot; does about 120% total damage per
crush, and &quot;slow hurt&quot; grabs you and does somewhere around 1000-2000%
total damage per crush.
9.  The &amp; symbol indicates that a sector cannot be affected any more by
other line types after it has performed this effect, even if it has
finished. These are the floor-texture-changers and... (keep reading)
10. Moving floors and crushing ceilings also &quot;lock out&quot; further changes
to the sectors affected, EXCEPT for restarting the moving floor or
crushing ceiling. If a line triggers a type 6 crushing ceiling in a
sector, then it is stopped, then ANY other line with a &quot;crush&quot; type that
is tagged to the same sector will cause the type 6 crusher to start
again, with its original maximum and minimum ceiling heights.
11. Some line types cause floor textures and/or some special sector types
(see [4-9-1]) to transfer to the tagged sector. The tagged sectors' floor
and/or special sector (SS) type will change to match that of the &quot;model&quot;
sector. The TRIGGER model gets the info from the sector that the
activating line's right side faces. The NUMERIC model gets the info
from the sector on the other side of the lowest numbered two-sided
linedef that has one side in the tagged sector.
  All of these &quot;change&quot; line types transfer the floor texture. Also,
they all can pass a special sector trait of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;nothing&quot;, i.e. if
the destination is an acid-floor or &quot;damaging&quot; sector, then any of these
lines can erase the damaging effect. Lines 59, 93, 37, 84, and 9 (see
note 12 for more specifics on line type 9) also have the ability to
transfer the &quot;secret&quot; trait of SS 9, and the damaging traits of SS
4, 5, 7, 11, and 16. None of the &quot;blinking light&quot; effects of SSs can be
transferred. SS 4 &quot;blinks&quot; and causes damage, but only the damaging part
can be transferred. SS 11 also turns off god-mode and causes a level END
when health &lt;11%, this characteristic is part of SS 11, and cannot be
isolated via fancy transfers.
12. Line type 9 is a special one. The definitive example is the chainsaw
pillar on E1M2. Take the lowest-numbered linedef that has a sidedef in
the tagged sector. If that linedef is one-sided, nothing happens. If it
is 2-sided, then the tagged sector's floor will move down to match the
2nd sector's floor height (or it will jump instantly up if it was below,
like other floors that are supposed to move &quot;down&quot;).
  If this 2nd sector CONTAINS the tagged sector, i.e. all the linedefs
with a sidedef in the tagged sector have their other sidedef in the 2nd
sector, then this 2nd sector is the &quot;donut&quot;. This donut's floor will
move &quot;up&quot; to match the floor height of the sector on the other side of
the DONUT's lowest-numbered linedef, excluding those linedefs that are
shared with the &quot;donut hole&quot; central sector. Also, the donut will undergo
a floor texture change and special sector type change to match the
&quot;outside&quot;. The donut sector does not have to be completely surrounded
by another sector (i.e. it can have 1-sided linedefs), but if its
lowest-numbered linedef is not 2-sided, a minor glitch results: the donut
and the donut-hole both move to a strange height, and the donut changes
floor texture to TLITE6_6 - the last flat in the directory.
  Note that if the donut hole and the donut are both going to move, the
donut hole is going to move to match the height that the donut is &quot;going
to&quot;. In other words, the whole thing will be at a single height when
they're done, and this is the height of the &quot;outside&quot; sector that borders
the donut.
  Whew!
13. Line types 30 and 96, &quot;up ShortestLowerTexture&quot; means that affected
sector(s) floors go up a number of units equal to the height of the
shortest &quot;lower&quot; texture facing out from the sector(s).
14. STAIRS. Any sector tagged to a stair-raiser line will go up 8. Now
find the lowest-numbered 2-sided linedef whose RIGHT side faces this
sector (the first step). The sector on the other side of the lindedef
becomes the next step, and its floor height changes to be 8 above the
previous step (it raises up if it was lower, or it changes instantly if
it was higher). This process continues as long as there are 2-sided
lines with right sides facing each successive step. A couple things
will stop the stairway:
    (a) no 2-sided linedef whose right side faces the current step
    (b) a sector with a different floor texture
    (c) a sector that has already been moved by this stairway (this stops
          ouroboros stairways that circle around to repeat themselves)
    (d) &quot;locked-out&quot; sectors that can't change their floor height anymore
  The component steps of a stairway can have any shape or size.
  The turbo stairs (100, 127) work just like regular stairs except that
each step goes up 16 not 8, and rising steps can crush things between
themselves and the ceiling.
15. Line types 78 and 85 do NOTHING as of version 1.666.
