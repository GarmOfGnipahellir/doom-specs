# id Software's Copyright and the Shareware Version

```
My comments and statements are by no means official, and the excerpts
below are just the parts that I think are relevant to these specs. Please
read the LICENSE.DOC and README.EXE that came with DOOM.

  The LICENSE.DOC says:

    "You shall not:  rent, lease, sell, distribute for money or other
    consideration, modify, translate, disassemble, decompile, reverse
    engineer, or create derivative works based upon the Software.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may create a map editor, modify
    maps and make your own maps (collectively referenced as the
    "Permitted Derivative Works") for the Software.  You may not sell
    or distribute any Permitted Derivative Works but you may exchange
    the Permitted Derivative Works at no charge amongst other end-users.
    In order to commercially distribute any such map editor or data
    utility you must first sign ID's Data Utility License and ID
    reserves the right to deny authorization to commercial distribute
    the any such map editor or data utility.  You may request a copy of
    the Data Editor License from ID"

    "(except for backup purposes) You may not otherwise reproduce, copy
    or disclose to others, in whole or in any part, the Software."

  The README says:

    "id Software respectfully requests that you do not modify the levels
    for the shareware version of DOOM.  We feel that the distribution of
    new levels that work with the shareware version of DOOM will lessen a
    potential user's incentive to purchase the registered version.

    "If you would like to work with modified levels of DOOM, we encourage
    you to purchase the registered version of the game."

  If you are making add-ons, plan on them not working on the shareware
game, and plan on including statements about the trademarks and copyrights
that id Software owns, as well as disclaimers that they won't support your
add-on product, nor will they support DOOM after it has been modified.
