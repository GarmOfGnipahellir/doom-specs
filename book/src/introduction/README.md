# Introduction

DOOM is simply an all-time great game. A big factor in its success
and durability is the plethora of user-created add-ons. id Software
tacitly encouraged them by including the -FILE parameter, and by having
a data format that is both straightforward and easy to understand.
DOOM is basically two files, DOOM.EXE and DOOM.WAD. DOOM.EXE is the
"engine" which does the display and controls the game, and DOOM.WAD has
ALL of the graphics, sound, and map/level data that the engine uses.
The -FILE parameter allows small or large external "WAD" files to be
incorporated, changing any number of those graphics, sounds, and maps.
  DOOM 2 has many things in common with DOOM. It uses the same EXE file
as version 1.666 of DOOM, and the WAD file format is the same. It's just
the contents of the WAD file that are different; there are more enemies!
more pictures! more weapons! more stuff!!

  This document explains in great detail nearly all aspects of the doom
WAD file format. And a new chapter (10) documents the location of data
within DOOM.EXE itself, so that various unusual game-play changes can
be made. This information has been updated to apply to DOOM 2 as well
as DOOM 1.
  The specs were originally conceived as an aid to programmers making
DOOM utilities, especially map-editors. Coincidentally, there might also
be information useful to advanced level designers and players.
  The material herein is somewhat technical and it is not recommended for
beginners, unless they are determined. There are some other very useful
documents in existence; I list the ones I know of in Appendix [A-3].
