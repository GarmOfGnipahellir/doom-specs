# What's New

```
Each new version of these specs renders the previous version obsolete.
  This document has grown considerably in size, and to fight that trend,
I'll not discuss it any more.
  It has now been five months since the specs were updated. I won't talk
about that either. I'll just apologize for not releasing updates in late
May and July like I should have. Those updates would have been numbered
1.4 and 1.5, so perhaps that's why this is version 1.666.
  Here's some of the new or revised sections since the 1.3 specs:

    - DOOM 2 info, especially in [4-2-1] and [4-3-2]
    - lots of info on the DOOM.EXE file in [10]
    - BNF style definitions in [A-1]
    - DOOM engine limits in [A-2]
    - the DEMO format [8-6]
    - the ENDOOM lump [8-3]
    - comprehensive list of WAD lumps in [3]

    - many parts rewritten for clarity
    - changes in terminology to reflect id's where possible, and to be
        more consistent throughout
    - reformatted again, errors and typos corrected
```
