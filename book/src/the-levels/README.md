# The Levels

```
Each level has eleven directory entries and ten lumps: E[x]M[y] (or
MAPxy in a DOOM 2 wad), THINGS, LINEDEFS, SIDEDEFS, VERTEXES, SEGS,
SSECTORS, NODES, SECTORS, REJECT, and BLOCKMAP.
  In the DOOM.WAD file, all of these entries are present for every level.
In a pwad external file, they don't all need to be present. Whichever
entries are in a pwad will be substituted for the originals. For example,
a pwad with just two entries, E3M6 and THINGS, would use all the walls
and such from the original E3M6, but could have a completely different
set of THINGS.
