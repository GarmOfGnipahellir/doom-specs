  The important releases as of this writing are 1.2 and 1.666. Hopefully,
everyone will move up to 1.666 soon; it has many important improvements
over 1.2. The 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 shareware betas contained increasing
amounts of the stuff that's now in 1.666, but there's no information
here about what exactly those changes were. One, I didn't keep track,
and two, they're not really important.
  See appendix [A-3] for some miscellany about what has changed from
version to version.
